		content="The current market for hiring senior developers is brutal, and there's no foreseeable relief. The pool of experienced, senior-level engineers is shrinking rapidly, and sometimes even winning the salary bidding war isn't enough to acquire the skills your company needs to move product forward. The demand simply outweighs any institution's ability to produce hit-the-ground-running ready developers. If companies want to be successful in the future they need to start building the workforce they want to see. Creating a sustainable model that ensures your engineering teams will be able to scale to deliver your company's product must include growth strategies beyond just what you can hire. This talk will cover how to interview better, how to spot skill gaps in current team members, how to build sustainable mentoring processes that don't overburden the current team, and how to create a long-term growth environment.
